## Description

A collection of useful hacks and workarounds to be used on KSP. Some gambiarras included. ðŸ˜†

Among the many tools, the following stand out:

### window_monitor

A tool to pause applications when their Windows lose the Focus.

Nice too to prevent memory/CPU guzzlers from screwing you when you are trying to do something else!


## Installation

To install the KSP assets, place the GameData folder inside your Kerbal Space Program folder.

**REMOVE ANY OLD VERSIONS OF THE PRODUCT BEFORE INSTALLING**.

The scripting tools should be added to a place where your `PATH` can find them, or alternatively you can edit your path adding the `utils` folder.

### Dependencies

* BASH
	+ Windows users should get away using Cygwin64
		- Untested at the moment. 
* Python 3
	+ Anything beyound 3.7 should work, but I'm developing and testing on 3.11
